[Demo this project Here](https://codepen.io/stepup2stepout/pen/XeNKOj)

Uses JavaScript, JQuery and the Twitch API.

This project achieves the following user stories:
1. I can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.

2. I can click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel.

3. if a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming.
